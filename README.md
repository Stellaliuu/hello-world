# hello-world
world with daydreaming people

I am a daydreaming person, I like travelling to a remote place where is very quiet and beautiful with my best friend, we could lie on the grassland and look at the stars for all night long.
I like eating, but I am little afraid of getting fat. I hate communicating with people, but the real world pushes me to do that.
Hey, nice to meet you.
